        <ul>
          <li>Raised in the Crimean countryside, <strong> Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky</strong>took to art at an early age and found sketching and painting as natural as walking and talking.</li>
          <li>He excelled in marine landscapes and decided to devote his career to painting seascapes.</li>
          <li><strong>Aivazovsky</strong> haunting visionary marine paintings evoke feelings of wonderment, timelessness, and tranquility. He never tried to render the natural seascape, but wanted to portray the emotions which the oncoming storm generates in the viewer. </li>
          <li>He preferred to paint scenes that suggested a feeling for the passage of time, such as the break of dawn, the transition from day into night. </li>
          <li>One of the most prominent Ukrainian artists of his time, <strong>Aivazovsky</strong> was also popular in Europe and in the United States. </li>
          <li>During his almost 60-year career, he created around 6,000 paintings, making him one of the most prolific artists of his time.</li>
          <li>Followers of this movement were influenced by the high standards of the French Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, which practiced under the movements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism. </li>
          <li>Most of <strong>Aivazovsky's</strong> works are kept in Ukrainian, Armenian and Russian museums as well as private collections.</li>
